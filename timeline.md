# Timeline

Day 1 - 06/08/2023

- [x] Remove the `year` column (v0).
- [x] ~~Using GridSearchCV and MLPRegressor (v2)~~.
- [x] Predictions should only in positive real (v3). 
- [x] [5 dimensions are enough](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20/discussion/429278) (v3).
- [x] Using DecisionTreeRegressor as a new baseline (v5).
- [x] Using RandomForestRegressor with GridSearchCV (v5).

Day 2 - 07/08/2023

- [ ] ~~[Volcano eruption](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20/discussion/429232) (v7)~~.
- [x] [COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20/discussion/429622) (v7).
- [x] [Using DecisionTreeRegressor & BaggingRegressor (for ensemble)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/johnsmith44/ps3e20-co2-emissions-in-rwanda-compact-trick) (v8). 
- [x] Using XGBRegressor & BaggingRegressor (for ensemble) (v10).
- [x] [Multiplying a magic constant.](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20/discussion/429675)
	- According the post, using a magic constant will boost the RMSE from 30.x to 2x. I'll experimenting this (but to be honest, that doesn't make any sense at all).

Day 3 - 08/08/2023

- ~~[ ] Try using k-fold to re-estimate all previous approaches.~~
- [x] Try using magic constant with best approach (v12).

Day 4 - 12/08/2023

- [x] Using [a magic to "solve" the bug in submission - caused by a week shift](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20/discussion/429717).

Day 5 - 13/08/2023

- [x] Using a Non-ML solution (v17 - v23).
	- Without a machine learning model, using maximum emission records from 2019-2020-2021 with a magic number can boost result to 23.

Day 6 - 14/08/2023

- [x] Try using lower magic.
